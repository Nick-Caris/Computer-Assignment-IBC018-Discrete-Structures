SYNOPSIS
    co_rr_solver [OPTION] [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
    All found recurrence relations in DIRECTORY that have filenames matching "comass??.txt"
    are inspected and a direct formula describing these recurrence relations is stored in the
    file "comass??-dir.txt". If DIRECTORY is omitted, the location of "co_rr_solver" is taken
    as directory.

    -v, --verbose
        print debugging information during execution of "co_rr_solver"
